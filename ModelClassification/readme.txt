**Important Note:** Due to the computational complexity of the SVM algorithm, especially with larger datasets, the model training process can take several hours to complete.  Please be aware of this when running the training script.

**Dependencies:**

* Python 3.x
* scikit-learn
* NumPy
* Pandas (if used for data handling)
